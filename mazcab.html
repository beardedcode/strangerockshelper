            <h2>Trinks</h2>
            <p>3 Daily Trinks(15 rep per day)</p>
            <p>Get Trinks from Trinks, once completed go back to get another</p>
            <p>Possible tasks: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a Traitor in the Nemi Forest. The traitor is level 5 with 1000 life points and thus is easy to
                    kill.</li>
                <li>Deliver a message to Acca Otot. Acca Otot will give you a message to take back to Trinks.</li>
                <li>Repair 10 fences around Kanatah.</li>
                <li>Kill 10 Airut. You are given Nemi poison for this task, which greatly weakens the Airut when used on
                    them. Airut poisoned with the Nemi poison give no drops.</li>
                <li>Free 5 Goebies from their cages by the Airut, and kill 5 Airut guarding them. Nemi poison can be
                    used for this task.</li>
                <li>Clear 10 fallen rocks north-west of Kanatah.</li>
                <li>Light the beacon north of the eastern entrance to the Nemi Forest. (The beacon is north of the
                    Goebie in the graveyard, don't go inside the forest.)</li>
                <li>Pick a Pahtli fruit from a Pahtli plant in the Nemi Forest to cure sickly elders. (The pahtli fruit
                    is plucked from a plant found in the forest)</li>
                <li>Collect 10 driftwood and return them to Trinks.</li>
                <li>Salvage scraps from 5 tents in Kanatah.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Kanatah is place you get Trinks</p>
            <p>Rangers can teleport you around to make for quicker navigation around Mazcab</p>
